# SZMemory-Shirt
SZMemory-Shirt is an e-textile shirt that outlines the metro map of the Shenzhen City where is the city that I grew up in. I spent 3 years in the United States and felt I have looser connection with my orginial culture. This shirt is put my experience and memory back to my body wearing it wherever I go. I picked Metro map is because metro stops are connected to different memories that I have with the city. The metro lines that I picked are the most frequent commutes that I took in the past - each pressure sensor is associated with one memory that I had.

I included two conductive pressure sensors on the sleeves of the shirts so that when I do different body movements, such as hugging myself, the LED and fabric optic tube will light up with white or blue colors. The LED lights will first light up when I triggered the pressure sensors and then fade away. The fading effect is also symbolized our memory will be fading as well.

On the back of the shirt, I used conductive thread to shape the outline of the Shenzhen City, a house icon, and a heart shape, which I used to connect the pressure sensor to the Arduino Lilypad.
