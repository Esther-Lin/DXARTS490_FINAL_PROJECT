# SZMemory-Shirt
SZMemory-Shirt is an e-textile shirt that outlines the metro map of the Shenzhen City where is the city that I grew up in. I picked Metro map is because metro stops are connected to different memories that I have with the city. The metro lines that I picked are the most frequent commutes that I took in the past - each pressure sensor is associated with one memory that I had.

I included two conductive pressure sensors on the sleeves of the shirts so that when I do different body movements, such as hugging, the LED and fabric optic tube will light up with white or blue colors. 

On the back of the shirt, I used conductive tread to shape the outline of the Shenzhen City, a house icon, and a heart shape, which I used to connect the pressure sensor to the Arudino Lilypad.
