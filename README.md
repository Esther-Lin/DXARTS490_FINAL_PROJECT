# DXARTS490_FINAL_PROJECT
My final project is to make an e-textile dress that outlines the metro map of the Shenzhen City (the city that I grew up in). Many metro stops are connected to different memories that I have with the city. I would use three to four switches to control the LEDs, which indicate the most frequent commutes that I took in the past â€” each switch is associated with one memory that I had. 
I would use the cutting machine to cut out the metro map and iron it on the dress (will further explore more options). I will also design little icons or patterns that symbolize my connection with the city. Once I turn one of the three to four switches, the controlled LEDs will light up one of my past commutes and also my designed icons.
